## Introduction

Welcome to the **WormGPTPScanner**! This project is a powerful network scanner written in Python, designed to help security professionals and enthusiasts perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. The WormGPTPScanner aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for identifying open ports and potential security weaknesses in networked systems.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick and efficient scanning.
- **Port Scanning**: Scans a range of ports to find open ones on a target IP address.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides detailed information about the open ports and their types.
- **Stylized Output**: Displays a stylized banner and user-friendly output for better readability.
